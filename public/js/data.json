Most children with autism look like other kids but they act and interact in ways that feel different from the behaviors of other children. When interacting with others, they may respond in unexpected ways, or they may not interact at all. ",
            "Desc2":"Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that it appears in a range of forms and levels of severity. Some individuals develop typical capabilities in terms of speech and language – and develop exceptional skills – but struggle with lifelong social and behavioral differences. Others may have challenges in communication, sensory sensitivities, and behavioral issues, such as excessive tantrums, repetitive behaviors, aggression, and self-harm. The good news is that appropriate treatments can improve outcomes for many, if not most, people diagnosed with ASD."

However, since the mid-1980s, the rate of autism has increased dramatically around the world. In March 2020, the US Federal Centers for Disease Control announced that 1 in every 54 children in the United States is affected by autism. Autism is more likely to affect boys than girls, but children of all genders have been diagnosed with ASD.",

            "Desc2":"The DSM-5, the standard reference used by most healthcare providers, includes a full list of autism diagnostic criteria. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should ask your loved one’s physician to perform an autism screening."

In 2016, a study from the American Academy of Pediatrics found that 81% of pediatricians “always” or “almost always” use formal tools to screen for autism in children under 36 months old.",

The ATEC is one of the most widely used assessment tools in the autism community. Although it is not a diagnostic test for autism, this checklist is designed to monitor how an individual progresses over time and to track the efficacy of treatment. Completing the ATEC can give you a good understanding of your child’s current symptoms to discuss with your medical provider. ",
