        <Qes_Title>The best treatment for autism is the one that works</Qes_Title>
        <br/><br/>
        <Sec1>First and most important, early intervention can make a big difference. The earlier an individual receives appropriate support, the better his/her prognosis.

        <br/><br/>Your doctor can help you decide which autism treatments are appropriate for your child. Keep in mind that there is no single treatment for everyone with autism. Instead, there are a variety of therapies that may be helpful addressing symptoms depending on the individual’s needs. What works for one person may be less effective – or ineffective – for somebody else.

        <br/><br/>As your child grows and develops, some treatments might become less effective, while others become more important. You should discuss these changes with your doctor to assure the treatment plan stays current.

        <br/><br/>Gathering reports from the treatment team and completing the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) prior to meeting with your doctor will help identify issues to address and referrals that may be needed. The ATEC is a helpful tool designed to measure changes of symptoms and behaviors over time. Note: Casual observations of your child’s development are typically not an accurate way to monitor progress. The ATEC provides a free, convenient tool that can be used to track changes over time. The checklist can also be useful to help determine whether a therapy is beneficial. To track a specific approach, complete the ATEC before (baseline) and after implementing a treatment and track changes over time.

        <br/><br/>For more than 50 years, the Autism Research Institute has provided support and guidance to parents and professionals worldwide, and we will continue to do so wherever the journey takes all of us.</Sec1>
